      " Hello, everyone. I'm Daniel Snyder from Seeking Alpha. Thank you so much for taking the time to join this webinar here today. We're glad that you're here. Or if you're watching the replay, also glad that you're taking time to watch the replay. So this one's exciting for us. This is an idea that Steve Kress came to me and he was like, Hey, we definitely have to start talking about what is going to happen in the markets when these rate cuts that are pretty much a solid certainty now are coming about what sectors do well with stocks are prime for potential growth here. It's something that everybody is wondering. And we definitely wanted to show you from the quantum perspective. So before we jump in, it's all of that with Steve and having out his predictions have been coming right. He's been calling for this week or September and for a while now. And now my question to him that hopefully we're going to talk about today is what happens in October. I'm going to go ahead and get a little housekeeping out of the way. So stick with me here. We are not advising you personally concerning the nature, potential value or suitability of any particular security. You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any investment security or strategy or any product or service is appropriate or suitable for you based on your investment objectives and personal and financial situation. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and seeking alpha is not a licensed security dealer broker or us investment advisor or investment bank. With that out of the way, Steve, I'd like to introduce you on as well and maybe give a brief background for maybe somebody that doesn't know who you are. And then let's talk about this quantum system and what you're seeing in the markets right now. Daniel, thank you for the warm introduction and we'll definitely give a rundown. My name is Steve Kress. I'm the head of quantitative strategies at Seeking Alpha and I've been with Seeking Alpha for about five years. I've been in the world of finance for well over 30 years. I would say the bulk of my career was spent at Morgan Stanley where I ran a prop trading desk in quantitative strategies. I've also worked on the asset management side. I've also started by own hedge fund in quantitative strategies and a FinTech company about five years ago that was bought by Seeking Alpha and that has brought me here, Daniel, and we have integrated our quantum technology into the Seeking Alpha platform and it's been a tremendous ride. So thank you for organizing this today. There has been a great deal of volatility and I've sort of, as you led in today, I've had this mantra since May and during May we saw a period in the markets where there was a rotation back into the Magnificent Seven. I'll go over this in our presentation but we hit more of a normalized environment from January to the end of April. If you recall in 2023 the Magnificent Seven did incredibly well and the basis of those stocks doing well really was, I think, instilled from fear and uncertainty and during 2023 interest rates were going up, inflation was going up, there was a lot of fear in the market so people went into the Magnificent Seven because those are the most profitable stocks and those stocks did incredibly well. As we entered into January the market normalized a little bit and we had a really good run for companies that had strong fund amountals but in May of this year there was a rotation back into the Magnificent Seven and that was really a new level of uncertainty that rates might not be coming down, that the embed could keep it higher for longer and that inflation looks stickier. As a result we saw a rotation out of stocks that had very good fundamentals, they sold off and a rotation back into the Magnificent Seven and since the time I really had the mantra keep calm and carry on and we've had a couple events where we really saw the VIX spike. Our vision from a quantitative perspective is to eliminate emotional investing and uncover top stocks using data-driven tactics especially in turbulent times and mid-market volatility, want eliminates the fear and focuses on fundamentals and really we are in a period of turbulent times right now and a great deal of market volatility, it may not feel like it because the S&P 500 is up on the year but the sectors that are doing this well outside of the Magnificent Seven stocks for a period are the more conventional defensive stocks and I'd like people to really turn this weakness into an opportunity. How do we work out a quant? What does it mean? Well we have achieved excellent results with quant and quant is really a fundamental analysis, it's no different but what we do is we take powerful computer processing models and we upload into those models just about every stock that you can think of that's a primary stock for the United States or ADRs and we basically layer over in our algo what is quant mental analysis or traditional fundamental analysis. So our algorithm tends to focus on companies that are collectively strong on value growth profitability, EPS revisions and momentum. Those are five core factors that we load into our model it's a completely data-driven process and what we do is we assign grades to companies and when we assign grades to companies we assign it to metrics that are commonly known as baby PE or return on equity or earnings growth revenue growth. We have about a hundred metrics that we assign grades to and a score and the companies that are collectively strong in those metrics that I measured score well hence we are able to come up with a directional recommendation that would be a strong buy hold our sell and the best stocks are awarded the strong buys. So today our presentation is going to cover the state of the financial markets it's going to cover sector performance across different phases of business cycles. We're going to be looking for top sectors and stocks for the first Fed rate cut which should be as Daniel mentioned in a couple weeks and the sectors that traditionally do well are healthcare and consumer staples but there are a number of other sectors that we're going to highlight too. So during sector rotations it's good to maintain a diverse portfolio because this helps to mitigate risk during periods of volatility. As I mentioned sector performance varies across different phases of the business cycle in a normal phase where the market is not based on fear and where a sentiment isn't driven by uncertainty we tend to see tech communication and consumer discretionary sectors outperform during these expansion phases for the market. During periods of economic uncertainty investors tend to rotate into stocks with strong probability we saw that in 2023 with bag seven and some more of the traditional sectors and some of the most more traditional sectors or defensive sectors would be utilities real estate healthcare and consumer staples. Financials could go both ways at times it performs well when the economy is doing well but at other periods believe it or not when we're entering a period where rates are going to be coming down financials can do well. So we have had an incredibly volatile period and the volatility has led to a number of people scratching their head so we know that there have been fears over inflation and interest rates geopolitical concerns and election concerns but not too long ago in July we had an economic indicator come out for labor growth and labor growth was still there but the labor growth number was a little bit lower than people had expected and the market went completely crazy selling off. So as you look at this chart you could see for 2024 the VIX was over 60 and the last two times that we saw that one was during the pandemic and the other was the financial crisis back in 2008. We are not on a pandemic and we are not in a financial crisis so it was very odd to see volatility spiked as much as it did. It did retract pretty quickly. I think outside of a couple people and talking heads that were panicked that morning I think a more normal behavior came back to the market but no question about it there is economic uncertainty there's a lot of anxiety over the elections coming up in November there's fears over what level of interest rate cuts we'll see and what interest rate cuts we will see in terms of the size. Investors have also fled to the bond markets recently so as money has exited from the equity markets we've seen it go into the bond market and that's changed the dynamic of interest rates and we are seeing slower job growth. There is still job growth but it is slower and one of the things that we're seeing too is every time we see the job numbers come out there's a revision from the previous period and we pretty consistently have seen declining revision numbers month in and month out. There's a great chart here today I'll actually let you talk about this one because you found it for us. What we're exploring here is the JOLTS the job openings which usually goes hand in hand with employment reports it's just another factor of a metric point of data that people continue to focus on and you remember the pop we saw during COVID and stimulus and how all these companies were just opening all these job positions and they kind of sat on the market and it was like oh well what's the worry if people lose their jobs there was I think a 1.8 to 1 ratio 9 to 1 ratio for people to find their next employment opportunity and we're just seeing more of a normalization between actually not from this data actually if you don't mind real quick Steve I might jump over to the Federal Reserve site which I think really showcases this a lot better. Sure you want to share your screen? Yeah I'm gonna go ahead and take it over real fast. So what we're seeing is really a normalization right so if you look back to the historical numbers here this is over the last 10 years you can see the normalization before pre-COVID and before stimulus came in we were in that you know 5 million 6 million up to 7 million range when the economy was doing well. This 10, 11, 12 million job opening opportunity here was not really anything that we've seen before and what we're seeing is just a normalization coming back to kind of where the economy kind of flutters along and what we're trying to see so some people call it normalization some people call it you know whatever they want that fits their narrative but the data doesn't lie and we're seeing just more of a normalization in the approach of interest rate cuts and where we're going. All right Daniel I will take us back to the main slide deck. Here we go and leaving off from the Joel's thank you for that slide. So another thing outside of interest rates and labor numbers this particularly you know every four years pops into the market some years it has more of an impact than another but there's no question about it. During presidential election years the market tends to underperform compared to non-presidential election years and you can see from this chart it's an S&P 500 season valid chart from 1976 to 2023 which shows the returns for presidential election years versus non-presidential election years and you can see it's really significantly different and you know what we're seeing basically in periods that precede November and the returns for the market after November. I think the nice thing that you know we can see here is that you know there is volatility before November but after November we pretty consistently see a nice rally in the market and I actually don't think that this year will be any different. I think there will continue to be uncertainty in the market up until the election especially with what we have you know with the Fed on the eve of bringing interest rates down waiting to see additional inflation numbers and waiting on labor numbers so there's a lot to stir the market up let alone the geopolitical events that are out there as well so it's going to be you know pretty crazy September and October and September is normally a pretty crazy month. Year to date what are we seeing on some of our sector returns you can see year to date utilities has been the best performing sector that is truly a rarity. Utilities tend to only do well when there's a lot of fear and uncertainty in the market and this year is no different. Financial services is up about 19.5% consumer staples another very defensive sector up 16% the third best performing sector that year to date and then we see communication services which actually you know Daniel there was a point where many of the communication service companies were considered defensive. You had your AT&T's out there and I guess for a long period you really only had AT&T out there but then you had some of the baby bells and those are the stocks that you know would do well when periods were uncertain. You can see now it's the fourth best performing sector with healthcare coming in at number five. So 2023 what did we see? Tech and consumer discretionary were the leading sectors in 2023 and there was a lot of uncertainty. The median return for the S&P 500 in 2023 was actually negative 16% but you had such major performance out of the bag seven stocks that it really took the rest of the index up but there were a number of consumer discretionary stocks that did well too. So you had tech leading 2023 being up 56% consumer discretionary was up about 39% and consumer staples and utilities were in the negative domain which is completely different from what we're seeing this year where there are some of the best performing sectors. So major rotations occurring in 2023 and major rotations the other way occurring in 2024. As I mentioned utilities are leading this year this is just a chart that shows what we had in that table before and just another picture and a different diagram but same point to this story. Again defensive leadership is really big in 2023 in 2024 a major shift from what we saw in 2023. So really what does this all mean? Because we are seeing such a big movement in the defensive stocks obviously a lot of people think that there might be a recession. So here are some bullet points that I think are worth highlighting. The longest yield curve inversion in history has just ended with a 10-year treasury now at 3.71% about a six basis point lead above the two-year which is now at 3.65. It was inverted for a very very long time. This chart that we're looking at on the right side actually shows the number of days as you can see on the far right hand side from July 2022 to August 2024 it was 783 days and we're seeing some of the previous periods where we had an inverted yield curve. Now historically that inverted yield curve has meant a recession but I will also say historically when the yield curve normalizes after prolonged inversion market volatility tends to spike due to heightened fears of an impending recession and we have certainly seen volatility spike as we saw in July at levels that we saw the pandemic and the financial crisis. The question is you know will there be a recession? Will it be a hard recession? Will it be a soft recession? So here's something else to keep in mind with history. Historically as I mentioned when the yield curve normalizes after a plum inversion market volatility does tend to spike as we saw. So number one recession risk a yield curve inversion is typically a warning sign of an upcoming recession. That's why markets are volatile when we do see these inverted yield curves. When it returns to normal slope as it just has it can mean the recession is either imminent or already underway. Now it's been pretty soft. We you know even with the job growth numbers that we're seeing people have to keep in mind that's actually still job growth. It's not going into the negative domain. Mostly when we're seeing these numbers come out it's just lower than analysts estimates and economists estimates but there is still growth. You typically don't see growth during recessions so that's something to keep in mind. Interest rate expectations. The normalization of the yield curve usually reflects changes in interest rate expectations often due to central banks lowering short-term rates to stimulate the economy. This can provide temporary relief to stocks especially interest rate setters as we are seeing with financials which are performing fairly well. That's something that I want you to keep in mind as we recommend stocks and sectors that will perform on the basis of coming out of the inverted yield curve and going into the first rate cut. Financials is one of the sectors that we will focus on. Market volatility. The transition from an inverted to a normal yield curve is often accompanied by volatility as I mentioned. This is as investors try to digest the changing economic outlook and most importantly point number four here potential market rebound. If the market believes the worst of the economic downturn has passed stocks may begin to recover as the economy stabilizes and growth expectations improve. This rebound may take time and depends on the broader economic context. So much of what I've been saying since May is keep calm carry on expect market weakness. Market weakness in this type environment is typically a cycle and those cycles could last anywhere from six to nine months. We are really coming upon a stage where the Fed in seven days could be making their first rate cut. As this chart shows this is the view of interest rate traders and it looks like the majority of interest rate traders 67% of them are expecting a 25 basis point cut 33% are expecting a 50 basis point cut. So in seven days we'll find out what it is. Of course I think the market would be completely shocked if there was no interest rate cut and then again of the market saw more than a 50 basis interest rate cut it might be pretty shocked too and having said all that the market might be anticipating this interest rate cut. So outside of the day when the Fed actually makes its cut and oddly enough when we do have the Fed meeting on those days the market does tend to be up. It's usually the days going into it that can be pretty volatile. Not really what's sure to expect this year because this is probably one of the most anticipated rate cuts in history. Steve real quick obviously we have thousands of people watching this right now just to put you on the spot because I know how I feel about this but just to put you on the spot what are your thoughts 25 versus 50 basis points? You know I think it's likely we're going to see the 25 basis point cut. I think the Fed has taken a long time to get to this point. You know they're not sensing that there's data out there that is showing a harsh landing or an imminent recession so I think they're going to go in favor of a 25 basis point cut. I would say the one thing that's concerning is when we do see the revisions for labor we've consistently seen a revision down like every month. It's always a little bit worse than they expected. Having said that the economy is in fairly decent shape. Companies have been reporting better than expected for both top and bottom line so I don't think there's really any data out there and then the inflation data you know that's come down as well so they're probably comfortable with it. I don't think they're seeing any signs of a you know an imminent recession or a hard landing so I think they're going to go with the 25 basis point cut. What about you Daniel what are your thoughts? Yeah I mean I think about going back to thinking about why are you cutting rates right and we've been restricted for quite a while and if they start aggressively cutting it kind of gives a little bit of a red flag to the market that they know something might be coming that's broken and that's not what they want to do right. So I say all this time with the inversion of the yield curve being what was it 700 days or whatever it was I definitely think if they come out just starting to cut by 50. I mean obviously we have CPI and we have PPI later this week so the data will be influenced a little bit but I agree with you I think it's more 25 let's get back to normalization let's start to simulate that credit becoming a little bit cheaper so that we can get back to more hiring and keep a more even keel level of the economy humming along. I'm sure a lot of people will be relieved by those rates coming down. So I wanted to show a little bit more history here you know what we could expect and I think for many people this actually catches them by surprise. Most individuals that you know aren't familiar with all these data points are often surprised they think when the Fed is lower lower rates or starts their initial cut that the market absolutely explodes to the upside. The truth is like you know in the weeks and months before that rate cut there's a lot of volatility in the market and usually what we find is like right after the rate cut and as I mentioned you know a couple seconds ago this is probably one of the most anticipated rate cuts in history the market could sell off into the news so even if we get 25 basis points or even 50 we could see a sell off the market. My guess is if we saw a 50 basis point cut we would probably even see the market sell off a little bit more severe but this chart shows what happens in the subsequent week to that first cut and the market is usually down. However I will point out if you look at a month or quarter or year after the market rallies significantly. So you know the two big overhangs on the market here are what the Fed will be doing with rates and the election and my takeaway from both of these historical periods is that you expect weakness in the market before the events but then the market tends to rally and rally fairly strongly after the events. Here's another table that gives you sort of a picture of the first rate cut going back to 1974 and you could see that the S&P 500 declined to low on average went down about 20.5%. So that's a pretty substantial number in terms of the market coming off. However the six months as you can see on the column on the far right six months return after the first rate cut is usually up about 3.4%. So there are only a couple instances where the market did not go up in the first six months after and pretty familiar with the data in those periods. We normally had to see really a long tail of rates going down for a while before the market actually rebounded after those periods but on average the market is up about 3.4% six months following the first rate cut. So September of course this is maybe a third element that comes into play here with the markets. September is not a great month for the market. In fact the win rate as you can see on this table here is only 30% during the month of September which means 70% of the time over the last 10 years the market has been down and the 10-year average for the market being down is about 2.6%. So part of this comes into that October mindset. October as you can see on this chart the market actually has been up over the last 10 years on average about 1.7% and it actually has a higher win rate at 60% for October. But October is pretty famous for some big milestone corrections. So as a result the market tends to be very skittish in September a month before October. So just to refresh your memories for October being such a horrible month in terms of history you had 1929 where there was Black Tuesday that's probably one of the most famous crashes in US history. You had October 19th 1987. Personally that was my first market crash where I was actually in the market. Boy I really remember that being a bad day. I will tell you that I think Wall Street had a very very tough time digesting that. I'd actually say you know what we have corrections now. You have a lot of veterans and even you know individual investors are somewhat used to these corrections but back in October 19th 1987 people were not accompanied to it and the Dow Jones fell 22% in one day. It really looked like the world in just one day was falling apart. Then you had October 27th 1997 there was a sharp correction attributed to the financial crisis and then you had October 10th 2008 which was more or less the financial crisis which lasted a number of years. You had the Dow Jones falling 7.3% in one day. So here are four historic periods and this is why people think October is such a horrible period for the market but in actuality September has greater sell-offs than October does and I think it's just people getting ready for that October effect in case you have you know big bad corrections occurring again. People start preparing for it in September and the market sells off. So my mantra continues stay calm carry on and at this point you really want to get your shopping list ready. So we've been through a tough phase since May. I'd say mentally continue to prepare for uncertainty look for opportunities. Investors can continue to loosen up on speculative holdings and speculative holdings really what I talked about this. This means stocks that you're not buying on strong fundamentals stocks that maybe you receive you know a tip from somebody who you don't really know saying hey the stock is going to do great without knowing anything about the fundamentals of a company that's what I consider pretty speculative. Dividend investors could really target dividend growth stocks in this period so a couple dividend growth stocks have started to sell off which means you get better yields and many of those dividend stocks have very strong fundamentals that are very profitable. Stocks that have performed well typically actually get hit hardest during corrective phases. So stocks that have strong fundamentals stocks that have really you know have been up maybe 50%, 100%, 300% that could be new flyers but are new flyers based on strong fundamentals. Those are stocks where people actually take profits pretty quickly because when the market goes into defensive mode they'll focus on utilities, consumer staples so they sell stocks where they've made money that's actually what you don't want to do. You want to stay with stocks that have great growth, great valuation frameworks but you know the markets trade off of sentiment they don't always trade off of fundamentals and it's conditioned in history to go where defensive sectors are so people will really sell good companies. This is a time to be looking for those good companies. Go back to the stocks that have strong fundamentals these stocks could be off anywhere from 20, 30, 40, 50% this year but they have very good fundamentals so those are some of the names that you want to look for because when the market does normalize those are the names that will come back the fastest and the quickest because they have really good fundamentals. So right now what we're focused on top sectors and stocks for a rate cut which we could be seeing in seven days so historically these sectors that do well are financials, utilities, real estate, healthcare and consumer staples and I would say even if you're in an environment that's normalized and not full of uncertainty you always want to have some of these stocks in your portfolio. You know diversification is a key you want to minimize your risk and you want to maximize your diversification this over the long call will give you the best returns so you always want to have some of these stocks in your portfolio and the reason why we're highlighting these stocks today is because they have terrific fundamentals so we're going to go through our list of five recommendations here one from each sector financials, utilities, real estate, healthcare and consumer staples. So we're going to lead off with one of my favorite consumer stable companies Pogroms Pride it is number one rated in the consumer staples sector it's also number one rated in the package food and meat industry it's a leading many of you know it it's a leading global package food company and meat producer they have a very differentiated product line they have great diversification and of course there's very strong demand for poultry there seems to be an insatiable appetite in this country for a chicken and it's always growing they had successful price increases that were led by supply demand and that definitely benefited the company during their last quarter Q2 EPS came in at $1.67 and a beep by 37 cents one of the things I want to highlight is the momentum on this company versus other consumer staple stocks so we're showing here on the bottom right hand corner we look at momentum as a key factor I mentioned the other factors were growth profitability valuation and earnings but momentum is also a key factor it's one of the most important factors in terms of quant metrics and we're looking at this so when you see that a plus grade this grade gives an instant characterization of how compares to the rest of the consumer staple sector and you can see across the board in the different time periods that we measure whether it's one year or three months or six months this company has much better performance than the rest of the sector that's a very important consideration because it tells you that they're doing a better job than the rest of the sector day I'm actually going to leave the presentation here and I'm going to go to the seeking alpha website and you can see this stock is off significantly today so as I mentioned there's going to be a lot of volatility in the markets during this period you're going to see some strong updates you're going to see some strong down days the this is coming off a little bit probably you may be some leftover sentiment from an M&A activity that could have been taking place in the sector there could be a number of factors out there that could not be related to that as well but this stock which you want to pay attention to are the strong fundamentals so when we look at the quant ranking here in the consumer staple sector we can see it's number one in the sector number one in the industry if you look in the middle of the page you'll actually see there are a number of analysts that cover the company that have a hold on it those are the seeking alpha contributors in the middle you'll see the recent news stories you can see wall street analysts and the seeking alpha contributors both have a hold on the stock and quant remains a strong buy and I could tell you quant has done very well this stock is up 74 percent in the last 52 weeks it's up 55 percent year to date so quant really nailed this stock I'll point this to the valuation framework and you can see compared to the rest of the consumer staple sector on a PE basis the multiple is only 10 this is about a forward PE it's only 10 versus the sector at 18 times so it's far far cheaper than the rest of the sector on a PE basis if you look at EV2Sales or EV2Ebada or price to sales pretty much across the board it is cheaper than the rest of the sector so what we're showing you here is the absolute data point the grade sort of gives you that instant characterization of how the company compares versus the sector but to the right of the grade you have the absolute data point for the company then you have the absolute data point for the sector and we show you what the percentage differences so it's a very transparent system I'm going to go to the growth page Daniel and you can see revenue growth EV2 growth year-to-year numbers were very strong versus the sector not quite as strong for some of the forward looking growth estimates however I will say the long-term growth estimate and this is very important because the near-term forward estimate is really looking just that sort of one year out but analysts at our forward estimates are taken from analysts so we're looking at analysts earnings estimates analysts revenue estimates anytime you see forward those are analyst estimates that we're taking into our model and you can see the EPS forward long-term growth rate three to five years out is an A plus for this company coming in at 42% versus the sector which will be growing at about 8% so that's a very powerful number it's a very predictive metric so when we look at all these metrics I will tell you they are not equally weighted when we come up with our scores some metrics are more powerful and others in terms of their predictability and I will tell you the long-term EPS is one of them hence that contributes to the overall A growth grade and we look at profitability you'd see overall it's a B gross profit margins are a little bit weak for this company but when it comes to the bottom line if you're looking at net income margins or the return on equity very very strong for this stock versus the rest of the sector and of course on a momentum basis A plus grades far far superior to the rest of the sector so that is pilgrim I'm going to go back to the slideshow and we are going to go to the next slide which sort of just as a recap on the company's second quarter 2024 numbers versus 2023 and you could see whether it's the revenue growth or the gross profit or the operating income all coming in significantly above the same quarter a year ago our next stock is in the healthcare sector so as I mentioned there's going to be five sectors and we're taking one stock from each sector we're looking for diversification to sort of endure this market instability and volatility tenant healthcare pickers symbol THC it is the number seven stock in the healthcare sector and number one in terms of healthcare facilities THC has a large diversified portfolio of acute care companies and specialty hospitals they have a total of 535 surgical facilities and they are the largest ambulatory surgery platform in the United States second quarter numbers came in great they came in at $2.31 and the beat was by 40 cents revenue came in at 5.1 billion which is a 0.41 year a year a beat of $99 million almost 100 million again if you look at the lower left hand side here you could see those sector relative momentum grades momentum far stronger for THC versus the rest of the healthcare sector whether you're looking at one year or three months the company definitely being rewarded by investors compared to the rest of the sector I'm going to take us to the seeking alpha platform and we're going to go to the stock page for THC this is a little bit of a better look today up almost 1% but you can see the stock has retreated and that's one of the things I want to highlight too even going back to pilgrims if we want to the stock page you know part of what we want to showcase here is companies that have come off recently so we want to use this pullback in the market to acquire some of these companies that have great fundamentals so pilgrims has come off of its high you can see in the last five days it's down about 6% tenant over the last five days you can see is off about 4.5% so that's really one of the reasons why I'm focusing on these companies it's taking advantage of the pullback that we've seen these are companies with very strong fundamentals so I'm saying buy these stocks on the dip so you're going to see that as a common thread for many of these companies seeking alpha contributors again coming with a hold and consensus Wall Street consensus is a strong buy in the stock you can see year to date the stock is up 104% so font has a good track record with this stock going to what's important it's really not important that the stock is up 104% that you know I don't want people to think they've missed this stock the important thing is to focus on the fundamentals so you want to look at this stock now it's evaluation framework you want to look at its gross framework and you can actually see if you're looking at the valuation framework it's an A plus now six months ago it was actually a B plus so the value for the stock despite it appreciating so much it's actually a better value now than it was six months ago so we're going to go into the valuation page here and you're going to see on a forward P basis it's an A minus so again that instantly tells you it's a much better value in this sector and you can see that multiple coming in at 14 times versus the sector at 21 times if you were to look at EV to sales it's an A minus coming in at just about 1.4 times versus the sector at 3.9 times so a steep steep discount on EV to sales and if you were to look to EV to EBITDA it's about half that of the sector so again a great valuation framework versus the sector a growth is really in line with the sector so if you're looking at revenue growth it's pretty much in line with the sector I think the numbers that look good is in terms of the EPS EPS they crushed it compared to the sector this year it's got an A plus grade for its year over year EPS number but even the forward EPS number looks really good coming in at 18% versus 8% for the sector so that's really important because we want to look into the future so most analysts are anticipating that the earnings per share growth is going to be far higher than the sector so that is definitely a key attribute for the company and then if we look at the profitability page you can see it's A plus overall for profitability whether you're looking at return on capital or return on equity huge huge return on equity at 114% financial companies like Morgan, Sailing and Goldman Sachs would be envious of that kind of ROE but we're seeing our margins look pretty strong as well so the the basic fundamentals for this stock look really good I'm going to take us back to the slideshow Steve I also want to quickly mention that if as people are watching this and of course we're talking a lot about valuation and the growth grade but also just to highlight the momentum factor grade that is on there as well what you've seen in these two companies that we've already talked about is they have strong momentum like it is maintaining that A plus grade so even these little pullbacks that are happening like you're talking about might be great entry points like the momentum is to the upside and the factor grades are showing that as well yeah and you know what that momentum means again it's sector relative you're comparing this stock to the rest of the sector so investors are telling you they like this company better than the rest of the sector and you know it's great when you see that over a one-year time period or a three-month time period or six months it's really consistent so definitely definitely an important factor this chart just highlighting a couple main points for THC as you can see you know some great numbers for adjusted eva dog growth for revenue growth for review case review per case growth and as well on the right hand side you know what it looks like for the hospitals and then on the bottom of the chart what it looks like on an aggregated basis overall so really good numbers all right going to the utility sector our best performing sector year to date quite a rarity but again these stocks do tend to do well in that period coming up to a first rate cut and a little bit after that and you always want to have a utility stock in your portfolio anyway it's you know it's just a safe way to go so we're seeing the number one quant-rated utility stock is talent energy corporation ticker symbol tln it's also ranked as the number one independent power and energy company it's a used and based company and they produce power in that region but they do operate across five states and 12 uh generational locations they have um their power is based in nuclear natural gas whole and oil so good diverse portfolio um we saw uh that the company recently returned over 900 million dollars of capital to shareholders through the second quarter i love seeing that in our companies especially the ones that don't necessarily have like a strong debt and growth rate it's always great to see them return capital to shareholders and in this case 14 percent of the shares outstanding were repurchased in 2024 so a very big testament that the company is using its cash to reward shareholders again very strong momentum as you can see on the bottom left hand side a plus is for this report card whether it's three months one year nine months or six months people are favoring this stock versus the sector let's jump into ck alpha's platform so we're going to go to the stock page again this one's performing a little bit better today up about one percent on the left hand side you could see the analysis from ck alpha contributors in this case whether ck alpha contributors are wall street we are seeing buys across the board so quite the trifecta here for the rating summary three independent sources ck alpha contributors have a buy wall street has a strong buy and want has a strong buy your date the stock is up 130 for an energy company this year that's an excellent return but again don't focus on that performance you might think a stock being up 130 i would be very expensive in terms of its valuation that's actually quite the opposite if you look at the factor grades you'll see the valuation metric here is an a minus versus the sector and a d versus its own historical period if you look to the valuation grade here three months ago it was actually a d so the valuation is better today than it was three months ago and the stock is up 130 percent year to date so again you don't want those returns you don't want stocks that it may be at a 52 wekai to dissuade you you want to look at the factor grades and you want to look at the valuation framework the growth framework and the profitability framework let that be your guide to decide whether you're purchasing a stock look at those factor grades they're sector relative they tell you how the stocks look versus the sector let's jump into the valuation page so you can see again on our conventional p e metric looking very strong in terms of the grade coming in at b plus the valuation coming at 15 times versus the sector at 17 times so it's about a 12 percent discount on a forward basis but if we look at it on a gap forward basis it's actually a multiple of 10 times versus the sector at 18 times so on a forward p gap basis that's at almost a 45 discount to the sector so that's a great valuation picture right there some of the other metrics uh i will say are expensive however when you do look at the overall valuation grade it comes in at a minus again these grades um in our model are not equal weighted uh we do change up the weights for these metrics based on a historical back test that goes back to 2010 and not all metrics are created equal some are more predictive than others let's go to the growth page and this is actually not a pretty picture and i'm glad that i'm showing this to you because this might seem confusing to some people when you're looking at this you see the overall growth grade is a c which places it in line with the sector um you'll notice that there's a number of metrics that are missing here um our model actually does not reveal all the metrics so you might think that this is a page it's quite confusing it is um and i will tell you that there are a couple proprietary metrics that we look at for growth and valuation we don't always share those those particular metrics in the case of this page um that are not being shown actually have very strong weights hence it's bringing up that overall grade so this is a very unintuitive picture um and i'm glad it's coming up because i do want to highlight that there are submetrics that we don't reveal and that's for competitive advantages you can understand uh and that's why that overall growth grade is coming in at c you will see working capital year over year is a b minus uh i'll give you a little hint there that is a very important metric uh it may not seem like an important growth metric when you're looking at um earnings per share and revenue and free cash flow but looking at our back test going back to 2010 working capital growth is an absolutely important metric hence that b minus you could see it's at 49 versus a sector at 33 percent and that over weighted metric is bringing up the overall growth grade uh let's go to profitability uh i get a little bit of a split picture here you could see some of the margins are not great versus the sector but you will see lever free cash flow margin and return on common equity these metrics here have a much higher weight than some of the other metrics as well as return on total assets so for prior to our reasons we don't show up because we don't want our competitors to see what the weights are but again our system is somewhat transparent and you could tell by looking at this picture what leads to this overall probability grade uh so the the devil is in the performance and we take a look at the stock you can see it's a strong buy based on our factor grades and the performance is up 130 percent so that performance lets us know that the quant metrics are working i'm going to take us back to the slideshow and we're going to go to the next uh company over here which is in the real estate sector so REITs uh traditionally you know when you're coming uh when you're in an inverted yield curve and you're entering that period where the Fed might be taking rates down uh looks quite strong if you went to the REITs in 2023 they did not look strong and they did not look strong in 2022 however as we're on the cusp of rates coming down we have seen some great performance out of the REIT sector what we're highlighting today is alexandra and baldwin ticker symbol l a l e x this is a number it's ranks number three in terms of diversified REITs and in terms of uh at ranks number seven for real estate stocks overall it's got a great dividend yield at 4.67 very strong balance sheet um and uh you can see that alexandra baldwin or has met or exceeded its ffo expectations for the last eight consecutive orders and has consistently taken up their guidance um so i'm going to show you on this page on the right hand side you can see what they have in land operations versus what they have in work brick um there's a big difference there but it's actually starting to reward uh the market by having that kind of balance i'm going to take us into um the i'm going to take us to the ck alpha platform and you could see over the last year the stock is up about 14 percent and year to date the stock is up only about 2.47 percent so uh this stock has had not quite the same run up that other stocks have but what it does have is grades are pretty consistent you know an inline with the rest of the sector but we're seeing that analysts are revising their numbers up here i'm going to click on the revision grade and you could see uh and sorry about that let's go back to earnings we're going to revisions and the earnings summary so here you'd see um if you look at the last 90 days uh the numbers that have been moved up uh and the ffo number you could see that there have been four analysts that have taken their estimate up and zero analysts have taken their estimates down in the last 90 days so this is telling you that analysts are positive on the company and that they're revising their estimates up and no one is revising their estimates down for the stock so that's always a strong sign hence the a plus grade compared to the rest of the sector if we were to look at momentum for this you could see uh it's sort of just above the rest of the sector if you look at the one year price performance it's up about 12 percent versus the factor at 10 percent if you look at six month performance it's up 15 percent versus the sector at 11 percent so you're seeing numbers that are sort of just better than in line um but what we like here is when we look at the dividend grade we could see that dividend safety grade is b minus uh and even though that's not a plus that's typically a pretty safe territory um companies that have a dividend safety grade between b minus and a plus typically 97 percent of them are safe and have not suffered a dividend cut according to our back test so we like that again the stock coming in with a yield that of about 4.6 percent um let's go back to the slideshow and we're going to come up on our next company which is in the financial sector financials you know typically can do very well going to the period of the first rate cut and when rates subsequently come down after that i'm highlighting today a company that ranks number 42 so it's not in the top 10 or 20 in terms of financial institutions overall but we're looking specifically at the consumer financial space right here where it does rank number six um you can see the momentum for this stock is better versus the rest of the sector um through the momentum grades going back whether it's one year or even the three month performance um which is in line with the sector overall it still looks pretty strong for this company and i'm going to take us to the seeking alpha platform and we're going to um the page show what i'm seeing here is some of these sectors are off sharply today as we saw with pilgrims and we're seeing with synchrony financial as well again the point uh that we're trying to make today is to look at some of these companies where the stocks have done well you can see it's up 45 over the last uh 52 weeks up 20 beating the s and p 500 year to date but over the last five days it's down 5.78 percent so consistently with the stocks that i'm showing here these are stocks that have clearly been winners where there's a little bit of a pullback and we're saying take advantage of the market volatility to buy these companies with stable uh balance sheets during this period and that's exactly what we're doing you can see the factor grade is very strong for the stock uh on an evaluation basis it's an a plus so even though this stock is up 51 over the last 50 uh 52 weeks and it's up 20 percent year to date that should not play into the equation okay what you should be looking at is the valuation framework for the stock now which is an a plus versus six months ago where it was actually a c so despite the performance that you're seeing in the stock it's actually a better valuation today than it was six months ago and the same is true with its growth as well currently the overall growth grade is an a six months ago it was a d plus so this is a company that's improved its growth outlook over the last six months compared to the rest of the sector um so you can see that so the stock has been rewarded but do not let that performance guide you let the factor grades and the financials and the fundamentals help you make your investment decisions profitability has been pretty strong over the last six months remaining at a plus um momentum and revision grades moving a little bit slightly to the downside but still this is really solid company also has a yield of about two percent uh whether you have c half of contributors they have a buy in the stock wall street has a buy in the stock and quant has a strong buy so you have the trifecta of buy ratings there from three independent sources again i'm highlighting stocks that have had volatility and as we see with pilgrim and synchrony financial today both of those are coming off part of the reason why we're focusing on these stocks are companies that have come off in the last five days to the last month going back to our slideshow here um and i think that actually takes us towards the end so i'm highlighting alpha picks which is a a separate product that i graded dale not everybody wants to do all this research um uh often investors you know they want to invest in stocks that have been vetted uh where there is uh an experienced investment professional has gone through the names and they don't necessarily want to come to the platform and do all this greeting on their own or try to figure out what sectors do best starting the first rate cut what sectors do best after the rate cut um so as a result of people not wanting to do all this homework about two years ago i created a product called alpha picks and alpha picks is a service where each month we provide you with our two top quant strong buys and you can see the performance inception two years ago is quite strong alpha picks is up 110 percent versus the s and p which is up 44 percent for the same period so again really this uh was devised for people who don't want to do a lot of their homework that want to say you know ck alpha has got a great quant system they've looked at our track record going back to 2010 they see that our quant strong buys consistently outperform the market but in this case they're saying you pick the stocks for me uh we don't want a lot of stocks we want to invest for the long term so we're taking stocks uh that we believe are good for long term investing uh we devise our portfolio for long term investors so we simply submit two stocks every month which are are strong by favorites couple other parameters and criteria that we have for the portfolio actually for this alpha picks portfolio we don't look at REITs uh reason being REITs have different metrics than uh other sectors so we try to eliminate it from this uh we do have a separate model for REITs we look at companies that have a market cap over 500 billion and we look at for companies that have a fair amount of liquidity so the average daily trading volume has to be north of about 10 million dollars we only do two ideas a month uh sometimes during the month we'll have a couple stocks that will be sold typically they'll never see more than four ideas in total a month maybe two buys maybe two cells we also keep our hold recommendations in this so a lot of times people ask me oh when a stock drops to a hold should i sell it and i'm like absolutely not a hold means hold we have sell ratings and strong sell ratings of the quant system when a stock goes to hold it typically means it's going to be in line with the sector or maybe a couple of the factor grades have um traded off a little bit factor grades are like report cards you know with a report card you know once you go for maybe a 92 average down to 90 that grade is going to change same thing happens with our grades for our quant system and that could often trigger a stock going from a strong buy or buy to hold so we tell people to hold on to it in the alpha picks portfolio we maintain them in there for about 180 days after 180 days of being a hold at that point we'll say okay let's bring some uh new stocks into the portfolio so that's a little bit about how the system works and i want to show you how it looks so if you took the year-to-date market returns alpha picks is actually outperform the s and p 500 and outside of highlighting that we've beaten the s and p 500 this year what i really really want to highlight in this chart is in the early part of the year so if you look at january through april you will see that the alpha pick stocks absolutely surged and this was on the back of 2023 when a lot of people were focused on the magnificent seven stocks so people were focused as i mentioned earlier on the mag seven stocks because there was a high degree of uncertainty in 2023 there was a lot of fear over interest rates going up there was a lot of fear on inflation and as a result people went into the mag seven stocks as we came into the beginning of this year people felt a little bit more comfortable with the environment and they began to sense that there could be a period and that we did experience inflation actually starting to come down and as a result investors were anticipating at some point the fed might be taking rates down so the market the broader market um did quite well and it did better than the mag seven so what i wanted to highlight is stocks that had really strong fundamentals and that's what alpha picks is about we're looking for stocks with really strong fundamentals those did incredibly well during that period of the year january through april but as i mentioned since may i've been telling people to keep calm and expect volatility expect weakness and that is exactly what happened and we alpha picks was no different we saw the stocks with strong fundamentals pull off a little bit and we saw the broader broader market come off as well alpha picks is still up your today compared to the s and p 500 but that's going to bring me to my next chart where we could actually compare it to the magnificent seven so uh before may you could see alpha picks actually absolutely crushed the magnificent seven in terms of performance people really returned to stocks with good fundamentals but then when we hit that period where the markets got uncertain and that uncertainty increased since may we saw stocks with good fundamentals sell off and this isn't just alpha pick stocks companies that had great valuation frameworks great growth frameworks a number of the ai stocks that did particularly well that weren't mag seven related they all sold off because the market became very very nervous starting in may and it started getting hyper focused on the election it started getting hyper focused on inflation being maybe too sticky it got hyper focused on labor wages and growth rates so there was a lot that made the market get a bit fearful and that fear actually increased from the end of april through july so we saw a massive sell off in stocks that had really strong fundamentals even at one point the mag seven started coming off but you could see post that uh april period the mag sniff is seven stocks just like they did in 2023 they absolutely skyrocketed and they started performing better than the mag seven stocks at this point it's actually neck and neck alpha picks is performing just as well as the mag seven my anticipation is uh september and october we will probably continue to see weakness uncertainty and volatility in the markets so that's why i'm like get your shopping lists ready because once we get into november the market will start to take a breath it'll start to calm down i'll say the election is over it'll say the first federate cut has happened maybe we have a more a couple more rate cuts happening inflation numbers will continue to probably trend down a little bit so a lot of that uncertainty that's been present in the market hates uncertainty once that uncertainty starts to dissipate we'll probably see the market start to normalize and that will be a very good period for stocks with strong fundamentals and stocks that are in the alpha picks portfolio this is a picture of what we saw in 2023 you can see the negatives in seven stocks went absolutely crazy okay and i will say actually in 2022 the mag seven did a horrible the mag seven actually underperform the s and p 500 in 2022 and we saw quite a reversion to the mean for 2023 where people came back into the stocks now there were other factors a lot of uncertainty in 2023 led people to stocks that had strong probability um you know that were cash rich cash was king and the other element for the mag seven stocks is these stocks had a leading edge in ai and people really wanted to participate in ai in 2023 so you sort of had this conversion that led to the mag seven doing really well in 2023 but i will tell you the anticipated growth or earnings that we're seeing for the mag seven stocks coming into the fourth quarter of this year is actually lower than the growth rates that we saw for 2023 so we're probably hitting a period where these stocks have done really well but the growth picture actually is not as good as it was so i would be quite concerned of i was in the mag seven stocks here um this is what 2023 looked like um looking at without the mag seven stocks and you could see alpha picks in 2023 was up 58 percent uh beat the naztec which was up 56 percent and alpha picks significantly beat the s and p 500 in 2023 so over a bunch of time periods we're seeing alpha picks outperform with the exception really of the last six months and the last six months is where we've seen a return to the mag seven we've seen sentiment driving the market not fundamentals okay and those cycles only typically last six to nine months sentiment you know can have a brief and strong impact but it doesn't it's not a sustained impact investors always return to fundamentals how do we know alpha pick stocks look strong okay despite the market um and despite alpha pick stocks being weaker over the last six months on the last quarter they just reported 33 out of 36 of the stocks beat eps expectations 83 percent were in line or topped revenue estimates daniel that is a huge number any portfolio manager on the street would love to have numbers like that the fact that 33 out of 36 of the stocks had beat eps expectations is a true testament to the fundamentals of the stocks in this portfolio so that doesn't mean that the stocks will always perform well obviously it's showing you in periods of uncertainty where sentiment drives the market that dictates what happens with stock prices but when you look at the fundamentals the fundamentals on these stocks are very very strong with 33 beating out of 36 and one of them was actually in line i almost want to say 34 out of 36 um had beat expectations so you can see the fundamentals made really strong so if you wanted to look at alpha picks that again this is a service where you don't want to do a lot of the work on your own we email you twice a month with our top quant strong buys there's a number of ways you can do it so i'm going to take us to uh the alpha picks portfolio here and the alpha picks portfolio um this is actually different than the seeking alpha platform so this is a separate platform i'm going to take you to the portfolio page so if you decided that you wanted to subscribe to this product there are a couple ways you can get yourself started um you could just look at the all the names and decide and read the articles so we have stories and twice a month we'll send that emails with analysis on each of the companies and you can actually comment on the analysis whether you like the stocks you dislike the stocks or if you have questions you can actually put those into the comment section and you could read a few of these and decide which stocks you like or you could say you know what to get started when take a certain amount of cash and put it to work i'm going to buy the top five strong buys so this is ranked in order of uh the strong buys so you can see zeta global ranks as number one right now that stock is that uh that came into the portfolio uh in august so not that long ago it's actually up 2.84 percent since that time period we actually put berkshire hathaway into the portfolio and dang you remember all the heat that i took for putting berkshire hathaway in the portfolio oh of course because everybody thought it was a cop out there like why are you just choosing the best stock that everybody knows about and look the return it's up 12 percent i you know i wish a few of those people could see the return that the stock has had since the beginning of july in this kind of environment so it was a great addition to the alpha pig's portfolio uh general motors that's another one where we took some heat so that stock has been fairly flat but really really strong fundamentals and uh the cash position has just been fantastic for general motors so that ranks number three t-mobile this is a stock that i had in the portfolio and i think for like a period of like six to nine months the stock did absolutely nothing people were questioning me all the time like why did you put this in the portfolio you know sometimes that happens sometimes the stock has to be in six months nine months a year the reason why the stock is a strong buy is because it's mispriced okay if this is a stock that was priced for perfection it would be a strong buy ready we're putting stocks our literally our quant strong buy means that it's a strong buy because the security is mispriced and when we put it into a portfolio and it has that strong buy ready that doesn't mean that it's going to get priced for for perfection in a month or two months or three months sometimes it takes maybe a year but eventually the market understands the fundamentals the stocks get rewarded and that's what happened with t-mobile stock down 36 percent app lovin is another uh case where that stock actually went down pretty significantly after we recommended it but eventually investors came to the stock it's now up 103 percent since uh november 2023 when it was put in the portfolio so you as again if you're new to it you could buy the top five stocks you cherry pick just buy one or two stocks or if you have a lot of capital you can invest into all the stocks and honestly with alpha picks whenever we sell a stock we actually buy all the stocks whether they're strong buys are hold on an equal weighted basis and our back test shows us that that diversification helps support folio over a long period of time and it maximizes the returns uh day i'm going to take us back to the slide deck and i think that actually really finishes up our presentation i'm going to stop sharing and uh day do we have any questions out there coming in from our audience i was going to say we're about here at the uh we're past the top of the hour and i'm going to be respectful yeah one time um but i do want to highlight that you do have a new pick coming out for alpha picks here i believe on the 16th so right before fomc so obviously if anyone if you're like me right sometimes you find that time is just short you don't always have time to dive into the research of every company i mean what steve has done with alpha picks is really remarkable i mean i know i'm in there every month reading the analysis and seeing what everybody's commenting the community that you built is incredible um anybody's very engaging very helpful challenging the status quo and obviously i i don't you know maybe don't attack me for sharing this but you have a lot of winners right you have a lot of stocks in that portfolio that have uh exceeded 100% on their return so i want to say first off well done thank you thank you if you haven't explored alpha picks please do so um but actually yeah so before we just jump out of here because obviously it's more past the hour i just want to recap the sectors and the stocks that we talked about today so going into this rate cut environment starting with our fomc meeting next week look towards financials look towards utilities real estate healthcare and consumer consumer staples and steve you just want to highlight the five stocks real quick for everybody to to recap real fast yeah dayan i'll go back into the uh slide deck too so they can actually uh see those picks so um as dayan mentioned out these are you know really good sectors to own during periods of volatility or specifically we were looking for sectors that you wanted to be in during the first rate cut uh so again the sectors financials utilities real estate healthcare and consumer staples and the stocks uh we have pilgrim pride we have security financial uh we have talent energy tenant healthcare and alex and baldon on the real estate side so these are stocks that you'd want to have in your portfolio anyway but as we're coming up to this sort of uh peak of market uncertainty with the first rate cut and certainly you know whether it's 25 basis points or 50 you know the market might sell off history has shown us the market is sold off these are probably good stocks to own during that sell off um keep calm carry on don't worry about your stocks with strong fundamentals fundamentals that have come off maybe 20 or 30 percent this is the period to get your shopping lists ready that period of uncertainty will come to end soon the elections will be over the first rate cut will take place inflation will be in line and you want to get your shopping lists ready now look at some of these past winners that still have strong fundamentals that's my guidance thank you so much for coming to this webinar today we really appreciate your time and attention yes thank you steve and just from my side of things if you haven't already jump on Seekin Alpha create that portfolio treat it as a watch list throw these five stocks in here and you can revisit it every day find the grade see the factor is everything will be right there for you so check that out and everyone thank you so much for tuning in this webinar and hanging out with us or watching the replay and we'll see
